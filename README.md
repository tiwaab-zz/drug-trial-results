# Drug Trial Results

The purpose of this project was to analyze a hypothetical drug trial. Two data files were provided, with clinical trial data. I looked at the tumor response to the drugs, the survival rate, how much the tumors spread, and the volume of tumor change.
See the analysis and results [here](https://github.com/tiwaab/drug-trial-results/blob/master/drug_trial_results.ipynb).

**Tools**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Numpy
